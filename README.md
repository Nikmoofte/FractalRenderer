# Fractal Renderer

A minimalist OpenGL application developed as a first-year university course project, utilizing the full potential of GPU shaders and ray marching techniques to generate and visualize basic 3D fractal structures. Built with the Delphi programming language (as required by the project guidelines), the program features an interactive 3D environment with a free-moving camera system. Users can navigate fractal scenes dynamically, adjusting camera speed and position via menu controls. The application also enables real-time tweaking of fractal parameters, with the option to save and load custom configurations to/from binary files for persistent storage. 
## Controls

space -- up

shift -- down
